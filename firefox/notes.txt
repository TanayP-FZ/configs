Trying option 3 here:

Can find persdict.dat here:
(will be different hash)
~/.mozilla/firefox/h2z2ok7o.default-release/persdict.dat

Super annoying that this does not allow optional capitalization. Must manually duplicate.

Would ideally like to use the en_US-large dictionary.

To search for which dictionary words belong to:

A previous extension used the large dict, but it is no longer maintained.
